title: Hello World

When starting to learn new programming language - historically, it has became rudimentary to start with **"Hello World"** example, so I decided to keep this markdown file which was originally included in gatsby starter blog, but changed content to have my say.

If you are wondering how I build this blog? check [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) for inspiration.

Since this is my first blog I thought why not try to remember all programming languages/scripts I've tried my hands on:  
```sh
C
C++
Java
Python
PHP
C#
Swift
JavaScript
```
<br/>
I'll be sharing few things from my past experience and document everything I learn. I will also suffix programming language in title to identify content easily.
