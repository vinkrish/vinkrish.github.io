When starting to learn new programming language - historically, it has became rudimentary to start with **"Hello World"** example, so I decided to keep this markdown file which was originally included in gatsby starter blog, but changed content to have my say.

If you are wondering how I build this blog? check [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) for inspiration.

Since this is my first blog I thought why not try to remember all programming languages/scripts I've tried my hands on:  
```sh
C
Java
Scala
Python
PHP
C#
Swift
JavaScript
```
<br/>

It is also worth mentioning some of the programming paradigms:

1. **Imperative** : Programming with an explicit sequence of commands that update state.
   - Machine code, Assembly language
2. **Procedural** : Imperative programming with procedural calls.
   - Fortran, COBOL, Algol, Basic, C
3. **Object Oriented** : Programming by defining objects that send messages to each other.
   - Java, C++, C#, Python
4. **Declarative** : Programming by specifying the result you want, not how to get it.
   - SQL, XML (HTML)
5. **Logic** : Programming by specifying a set of facts and rules.
   - Prolog, Planner
6. **Functional** : Programming with function calls that avoid any global state.    
   - Lisp, Haskell

I'll be sharing few things from my past experience and document everything I learn.
