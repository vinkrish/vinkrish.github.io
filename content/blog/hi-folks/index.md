# 5 Years in Software: A Personal Retrospective

It's been five years since I began my journey in the software industry. Along the way, I’ve changed jobs, founded a startup (and experienced the sting of its failure), and constantly evaluated my path. This post is an attempt to reflect on those years—putting my thoughts into words not only helps me process the past but also shapes how I plan for the future.

## The Beginning

Back when I was graduating with a degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering, the fear of joblessness was very real. The recession was still fresh in our minds, and the sheer number of students entering the job market each year made everything feel uncertain.

I wasn’t cut out for a job in my field, but programming caught my attention. That led me to pursue a Master’s in Computer Science. Looking back now, I sometimes wonder if I even needed a degree to reach where I am today—but the truth is, I wasn’t the same person back then. I don’t regret that decision. If there’s one thing I do regret, it’s not making the most out of my first computer, which I got at the age of 20.

## Success (Redefined)

I often hear success stories from people who had access to computers and learning resources at a young age. That wasn’t my case—but despite being late to the party, I’ve managed to carve out my own space in this industry. And that, to me, is a success worth celebrating.

## The Quiet Struggle of Being an Introvert

Being an introvert has its downsides, especially in tech where collaboration and communication are key. I've been working on speaking up more—sharing ideas, asking questions, and contributing to discussions. It's a slow process, but an essential one, especially when I reflect on opportunities I missed simply because I stayed quiet.

## Forgetfulness (My Lifelong Quirk)

If there’s one constant in my life, it’s been my forgetfulness. I’ve been healthy and active, but memory—particularly short-term memory—has always been my weak spot. I can pick up new programming languages quickly, but remembering their syntax after moving to something else? That’s another story.

It affects me especially in Data Structures and Algorithms. Unless I’ve recently reviewed them, I struggle to recall even the basics during conversations or interviews. It’s frustrating, but I’ve learned to work around it with documentation and repetition.

## The Feeling of Being a Consumer

There’s an underlying guilt that comes from being a user of open-source software rather than a contributor. I often find myself thinking, “People out there are building amazing things, and I’m just using their work.” I know I have the skills to contribute, and I’m working toward reaching a point where I feel confident and capable of giving back to the community that has helped me so much.

## A Relentless Curiosity

One thing I’m proud of is my curiosity and love for learning. Over the past few years, I’ve explored:

- Android app development
- Angular and React
- Java and Node.js backend
- GraphQL, MySQL, MongoDB, ElasticSearch

Most of my work and demo projects are documented on [GitHub](https://github.com/vinkrish), and now, with this blog, I’m pushing myself to go a step further—by writing more consistently, being more proactive, and even considering creating YouTube content to share what I learn.

## What’s Next

This year, I'm diving into:
- Python
- Machine Learning
- DevOps tools like Docker and Kubernetes

To be honest, I’m uncertain how far I’ll go in these new territories. These are complex, competitive fields. But that’s never stopped me before. I’m here to give it my best—just like I always have.

Thanks for reading. This post is a snapshot of my journey—a mix of success, doubt, growth, and aspiration. If you're on a similar path, I hope this resonates with you. Let's keep learning.
