### Turning SQL WHERE Clauses into React QueryBuilder Rules — Introducing querybuilder-sql-adapter

In modern UI platforms that allow users to build complex filters or queries, it’s common to use visual query builders — drag-and-drop UIs that abstract away the raw SQL or backend logic. One popular and powerful library for this is react-querybuilder. But what happens when you already have SQL WHERE clauses and want to visualize or edit them?

That’s exactly the gap this project aims to fill.

## Why This Was Needed

In many internal admin tools or no-code platforms, users often write or are provided with SQL WHERE clauses. Developers want to:
Parse an existing SQL expression
Visualize it in a frontend UI
Allow editing using a builder like react-querybuilder

However, react-querybuilder doesn’t natively support converting SQL strings into its RuleGroupType format — and while it provides utilities to generate SQL from rules, the reverse transformation (SQL → rules) was missing.

This project solves that.

## What This Project Does

The querybuilder-sql-adapter:
 - Parses SQL WHERE clauses using node-sql-parser
 - Transforms the AST into RuleGroupType format used by react-querybuilder
 - Supports nested expressions, CASE WHEN, COALESCE, IS NULL, BETWEEN, math expressions, and more
 - Outputs rules that can be round-tripped back to SQL
 - Supports advanced expressions using a raw: true structure for complex right-hand values

## Example

```
import { parseWhereClauseToRuleGroup } from '../src/sqlWhereToRuleGroup';
import { formatQuery } from 'react-querybuilder';

const fieldSources = [
  { name: 'field1' },
  { name: 'field2' },
  { name: 'status' },
  { name: 'field3' },
  { name: 'discount' },
  { name: 'name' },
  { name: 'price' },
  { name: 'category' },
  { name: 'field4' },
  { name: 'score' },
  { name: 'discounted_price' },
  { name: 'field5' },
];

const whereClause = `
(
  (field1 + field2 * 2 < 100 OR status IN ('active', 'pending'))
  AND field3 IS NOT NULL
  AND discount BETWEEN 10 AND 50
  AND name LIKE 'A%'
  AND COALESCE(price, CASE WHEN category = 'electronics' THEN 99 ELSE 49 END) = 99
  AND field4 IS NULL
  AND score > COALESCE(discounted_price, CASE WHEN field5 = 'gold' THEN 200 ELSE 100 END)
)
`;

const ruleGroup = parseWhereClauseToRuleGroup(whereClause, fieldSources);

console.log('Parsed RuleGroup:', JSON.stringify(ruleGroup, null, 2));

## Internals

The utility walks the parsed SQL AST and recursively transforms expressions into RuleGroupType rules. It handles:
 - Logical operators: AND, OR
 - Math: field1 + field2 * 3
 - Functions: COALESCE, IFNULL, etc.
 - Null checks: IS NULL, IS NOT NULL
 - Conditional logic: CASE WHEN ... THEN ... END
 - Literal handling: strings, numbers, booleans

## Try It Out 

```bash 
npm install querybuilder-sql-adapter
```
