I wanted to create docs for the course I enrolled which would help me for future reference, the course offers subtitle and I don't wanted to search through subtitle then copy-paste content for docs so I decided to convert those subtitle files into text files and then copy whole text into [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) (which is the my reference documentation).
