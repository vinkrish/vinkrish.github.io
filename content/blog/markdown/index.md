title: First Thing First - Learn Markdown

I have so many github repos and none of them had proper README.md in it because I thought markdown is yet another markup language which requires learning.

Before bringing this blog up I learnt markdown and documented it as public gist. Here I'm sharing the same gist - thanks to people at **[gatsby-remark-embed-gist](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-embed-gist/)** for developing gatsby plugin which allows embedding gist directly into markdown.

### Below are the original markdown markup

If you are want to build static website from CMS or markdown files I would recommend [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) which can use abundant React component available at your disposal along with GraphQL and there are simple ones requiring no knowledge on specific language: [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) & [Blot](https://blot.im/)

Before taking things live you can view how markdown actually looks after it is processed or even live edit [here - Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) and then copy the content to your markdown.
